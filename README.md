Cryptography
============
A small software with the ability to use simple bijectives encryption algortihms to cipher or decipher text messages.
It's also able to generate keys for encryption and to save the key in a text file ready for exportation.
I also added a GUI so that it is easy-to-use.

The code, comments and UI are in French

Implemented ciphers :
-> RSA
-> Merkle-Hellman
-> Beale
-> Playfair
-> Vigenere
-> Wolseley
-> Enigma
-> Caesar
-> rot13
-> rot47
