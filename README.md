Cryptography
============
A small software with the ability to use simple bijectives encryption algortihms to cipher or decipher text messages.<br>
It's also able to generate keys for encryption and to save the key in a text file ready for exportation.<br>
I also added a GUI so that it is easy-to-use.<br>
<br>
The code, comments and UI are in French<br>
The hub contains a ready-to-import eclipse project <br>
<br>
Implemented ciphers :<br>
-> RSA <br>
-> Merkle-Hellman<br>
-> Beale<br>
-> Playfair<br>
-> Vigenere<br>
-> Wolseley<br>
-> Enigma<br>
-> Caesar<br>
-> rot13<br>
-> rot47<br>
